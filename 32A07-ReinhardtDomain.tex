\begin{defn}
We call an open set $G \subset {\mathbb{C}}^n$ a {\em Reinhardt domain}
if $(z_1,\ldots,z_n) \in G$ implies that 
$(e^{i\theta_1}z_1,\ldots,e^{i\theta_n}z_n) \in G$ for all real
$\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_n$.
\end{defn}

The reason for studying these kinds of domains is that
\PMlinkname{logarithmically convex}{LogarithmicallyConvexSet}
Reinhardt domain are the domains of convergence of power series in
several complex variables.  Note that in one complex variable, a 
\PMlinkescapetext{logarithmically convex}
Reinhardt domain is just a disc.

Note that the intersection of
\PMlinkescapetext{logarithmically convex}
Reinhardt domains is still a
\PMlinkescapetext{logarithmically convex}
Reinhardt domain, so for every Reinhardt domain, there is a smallest
\PMlinkescapetext{logarithmically convex}
Reinhardt domain which contains it.

\begin{thm}
Suppose that $G$ is a Reinhardt domain which contains 0 and
that $\tilde{G}$ is the smallest 
\PMlinkescapetext{logarithmically convex}
Reinhardt domain such that $G \subset \tilde{G}$.  Then
any function holomorphic on $G$ has a holomorphic \PMlinkescapetext{extension}
to $\tilde{G}$.
\end{thm}

It actually turns out that a 
\PMlinkescapetext{logarithmically convex}
Reinhardt domain is a domain of convergence.

\PMlinkescapetext{Simple} examples of 
\PMlinkescapetext{logarithmically convex}
Reinhardt domains in ${\mathbb{C}}^n$ are polydiscs such as
$\underbrace{{\mathbb{D}} \times \cdots \times {\mathbb{D}}}_n$
where ${\mathbb{D}} \subset {\mathbb{C}}$ is the unit disc.
