For a complex analytic subvariety $V$ and $p \in V$ a regular point, let $\dim_p V$ denote the complex dimension of $V$ near the point $p.$

\begin{thm}[Remmert-Stein]
Let $U \subset {\mathbb{C}}^n$ be a \PMlinkname{domain}{Domain2} and let $S$ be a complex analytic subvariety of $U$ of
dimension $m < n.$  Let $V$ be a complex analytic subvariety of $U \backslash S$ such that $\dim_p V > m$ for all
regular points $p \in V.$  Then the closure of $V$ in $U$ is an analytic variety in $U.$
\end{thm}

The condition that $\dim_p V > m$ for all regular $p$ is the same as saying that all the irreducible
components of $V$ are of dimension strictly greater than $m.$  To show that the restriction on the dimension
of $S$ is ``sharp,''
consider the following example where the dimension of $V$ equals the dimension of $S$.
Let $(z,w) \in {\mathbb C}^2$ be our coordinates and let $V$ be defined by $w = e^{1/z}$ in ${\mathbb C}^2 \setminus S,$ where $S$ is defined by $z = 0.$  The closure of $V$ in ${\mathbb C}^2$ cannot possibly be
analytic.  To see this look for example at $W = \overline{V} \cap \{ w = 1 \}.$
If $\overline{V}$ is analytic then $W$ ought to be a zero dimensional
complex analytic set and thus a set of isolated points, but it has a limit point $(0,1)$ by Picard's theorem. 

Finally note that there are various generalizations of this theorem where the set $S$ need not be a variety,
as long as it is of small enough dimension.  Alternatively, if $V$ is of finite volume, we can weaken the
restrictions on $S$ even further.
