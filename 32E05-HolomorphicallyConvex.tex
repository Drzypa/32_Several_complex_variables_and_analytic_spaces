\begin{document}
Let $G \subset {\mathbb{C}}^n$ be a domain, or alternatively for a more general definition let $G$ be an $n$ dimensional complex analytic manifold.
Further let ${\mathcal{O}}(G)$ stand for the set of holomorphic functions on $G$.

\begin{defn}
Let $K \subset G$ be a compact set.
We define the {\em holomorphically \PMlinkescapetext{convex hull}} of $K$ as
\begin{equation*}
\hat{K}_G := \{ z \in G \mid \lvert f(z) \rvert \leq \sup_{w \in K} \lvert f(w) \rvert \text{ for all } f \in {\mathcal{O}}(G) \} .
\end{equation*}
The domain $G$ is called {\em holomorphically convex} if for every $K \subset G$ compact in $G$, $\hat{K}_G$ is also compact in $G$.  Sometimes this is just abbreviated as {\em holomorph-convex}.
\end{defn}

Note that when $n=1$, any domain $G$ is holomorphically convex since when $n=1$ $\hat{K}_G = K$ for all compact $K \subset G$.  Also note that this is the same as being a domain of holomorphy.
