\begin{defn}
A complex manifold $M$ of complex dimension $n$ is a {\it Stein manifold} if it satisfies the following properties
\begin{enumerate}
\item $M$ is holomorphically convex,
\item if $z,w \in M$ and $z \not= w$ then $f(z) \not= f(w)$
for some function $f$ holomorphic on $M$ (i.e. $M$ is {\it holomorphically separable}),
\item for every $z \in M$ there are holomorphic functions $f_1,\ldots,f_n$
which form a coordinate system at $z$ (i.e. $M$ is {\it holomorphically spreadable}).
\end{enumerate}
\end{defn}

Stein manifold is a generalization of the concept of the domain of holomorphy to manifolds.  Furthermore, Stein manifolds are the generalizations of Riemann surfaces in higher dimensions.  Every noncompact Riemann surface is a Stein manifold
by a theorem of Behnke and Stein.
Note that every domain of holomorphy in ${\mathbb{C}}^n$ is a Stein manifold.
It is not hard to see that every closed complex submanifold of a Stein manifold is Stein.

\begin{thm}[Remmert, Narasimhan, Bishop]
If $M$ is a Stein manifold of dimension $n$.  There exists a \PMlinkname{proper}{ProperMap} holomorphic embedding of $M$ into ${\mathbb{C}}^{2n+1}$.
\end{thm}

Note that no compact complex manifold can be Stein since compact complex manifolds have no holomorphic functions.  On the other hand, every compact complex manifold is holomorphically convex.
