\begin{thm}
Suppose $V$ is an analytic variety in an open set $U \subset {\mathbb{C}}^n$
($n \geq 2$)
of dimension at most $n-2$ and suppose that $f \colon U \backslash V \to
{\mathbb{C}}$ is holomorphic.  Then there exists a unique holomorphic 
extention of $f$ to all of $U$.
\end{thm}

Note that when $V$ is 0 dimensional (a point) then this is just a special 
case of the Hartogs' phenomenon.  Also note the similarity to Riemann's 
removable singularity theorem in several variables, where however we also assume that $f$ is locally bounded.
