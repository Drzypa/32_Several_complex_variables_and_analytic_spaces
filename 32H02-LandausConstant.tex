\begin{document}
We suggest that the reader reads first the entry on Bloch's constant. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be the set of all functions $f$ holomorphic on a region containing the
closure of the disk $D=\{z\in\mathbb{C}:|z|<1\}$ and satisfying
$f(0)=0$ and $f'(0)=1$. For each $f\in\mathcal{F}$ let $\lambda(f)$
be the supremum of all numbers $r$ such that there is a disk
$S\subset D$ such that $f(S)$ contains a disk of radius $r$ (notice that here we don't require $f$ to be injective on $S$).

\begin{defn}
Landau's constant $L$ is defined by 
$$L=\inf \{ \lambda(f) : f\in \mathcal{F}\}.$$
\end{defn}

Let $B$ be Bloch's constant. Then, clearly, $L\geq B$. The exact value of $L$ (as that of $B$) is not known but it has been shown that $0.5 \leq L \leq 0.56$. In particular, it is known that $L$ is strictly greater than $B$.
