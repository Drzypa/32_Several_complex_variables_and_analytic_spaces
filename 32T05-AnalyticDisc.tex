\begin{defn}
Let $D := \{ z \in {\mathbb{C}} \mid \lvert z \rvert < 1 \}$ be the
open unit disc.  A non-constant holomorphic mapping $\varphi \colon D \to
{\mathbb{C}}^n$ is called an {\em analytic disc} in ${\mathbb{C}}^n$.  The
\PMlinkescapetext{term} really refers to both the embedding and the image.
If the mapping $\varphi$ extends continuously to the closed unit disc
$\bar{D}$, then $\varphi(\bar{D})$ is called a {\em closed analytic disc}
and $\varphi(\partial D)$ is called the {\em boundary of a closed analytic
disc}.
\end{defn}

Analytic discs play in some sense a role of line segments in ${\mathbb{C}}^n$.
For example they give another way to see that a domain
$G \subset {\mathbb{C}}^n$ is pseudoconvex.  See the Hartogs Kontinuitatssatz
theorem.

Another use of analytic discs are as a technique for extending CR functions on generic manifolds \cite{ber:submanifold}.  The idea here is that you can always extend a function from the boundary of a disc to the inside of the disc by solving the Dirichlet problem.

\begin{defn}
A closed analytic disc $\varphi$ is said to be {\em attached}
to a set $M \subset
{\mathbb{C}}^n$ if $\varphi(\partial D) \subset M$, that is if $\varphi$
maps the boundary of the unit disc to $M$.
\end{defn}

Analytic discs are also used for defining the Kobayashi metric and thus plays a role in the study of invariant metrics.
