\begin{defn}
Suppose $G \subset {\mathbb{C}}^n$ is a domain and let $W \subset G$
be an open set.  Let $f_1,\ldots,f_k \colon W \to {\mathbb{C}}$ be holomorphic 
functions.  Then if the set
\begin{equation*}
\Omega := \{ z \in W \mid \lvert f_j (z) \rvert < 1 , j=1,\ldots,k \}
\end{equation*}
is relatively compact in $W$, we say that $\Omega$ is an
{\em analytic polyhedron} in $G$.  Sometimes it is denoted
$\Omega(f_1,\ldots,f_k)$.  Further $(W,f_1,\ldots,f_k)$ is called the
{\em \PMlinkescapetext{frame} of the analytic polyhedron}.
\end{defn}

An analytic polyhedron is automatically a domain of holomorphy by using
the functions that define it as $g(z) := \frac{1}{e^{i\theta}-f_j(z)}$ to
show that $g$ cannot be extended beyond a point where $f_j(z) = e^{i\theta}$.
Every boundary point of $\Omega$ is of that form for some $f_j$.

Furthermore every domain of holomorphy can be exhausted by analytic polyhedra (that is, every compact subset is contained in an analytic polyhedron)
and in fact only domains of holomorphy can be exhausted by analytic
polyhedra, see the Behnke-Stein theorem.

Note that sometimes $W$ is required to be homeomorphic to the unit ball.
