\begin{document}
Let $M \subset {\mathbb{C}}^n$ be a smooth submanifold of real codimension 1.  Let $p \in M$
and let $r_p$ denote the generator of the principal ideal of germs at $p$ of smooth functions vanishing on $M$.
Define the number
\begin{equation*}
\Delta_1(M,p) = \sup_{z} \frac{v(z^* r_p)}{v(z)} ,
\end{equation*}
where $z$ ranges over all parametrized holomorphic curves $z \colon {\mathbb{D}} \to {\mathbb{C}}^n$ (where
${\mathbb{D}}$ is the unit disc) such that $z(0) = 0$, $v$ is the order of vanishing at the origin, and
$z^* r_p$ is the composition of $r_p$ and $z$.
The order of vanishing $v(z)$ is $k$ if $k$ is the smallest integer such that the $k$th derivative of $z$ is nonzero at the origin and all derivatives of smaller order are zero at the origin.  Infinity is allowed for $v(z)$ if all derivatives vanish.

We
say $M$ is of \emph{\PMlinkescapetext{finite type}} (or finite 1-type)
at $p \in M$ in the sense of D'Angelo if
\begin{equation*}
\Delta_1(M,p) < \infty .
\end{equation*}

If $M$ is real analytic, then $M$ is finite type at $p$ if and only if
there does not exist any germ of a complex analytic subvariety at $p \in M$, that is contained in $M$.
If $M$ is only smooth, then it is possible that $M$ is not finite type, but does not contain a germ of a holomorphic curve.  However, if $M$ is not finite type, then there exists a holomorphic curve which ``touches'' $M$ to infinite order.

The Diederich-Fornaess theorem can be then restated to say that every compact real analytic
subvariety of ${\mathbb{C}}^n$ is of D'Angelo finite type at every point.
